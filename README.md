# Advent of Code 2024

My attempts at the problems specified for the Advent of Code 2024 event, implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Each day of the month (`n = 1-25`) is implemented in its own standalone Cargo project in a subdirectory named `aoc_<n>`.

To generate a new day, run:

```Shell
./gen.sh <day_number>
```
